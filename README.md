Satellite-Based Water Temperature Monitoring Platform

This project is a web-based platform for monitoring real-time water temperature data from Ecostress and Sentinel 2 satellites. The platform visualizes temperature trends across major water bodies in Southeast Asia, allowing users to track water temperature, view historical data, and see predictions for various locations.

Features

Real-time temperature monitoring: View water temperature data for dams and rivers in Southeast Asia.
Interactive Charts: Line charts for historical temperature data and doughnut charts for future temperature predictions.
Location-Based Data: Select from various water body locations (e.g., Baleh Dam, Murum Dam, Bakun Dam) and see relevant data.
Map Visualization: Interactive map displaying dam locations with hoverable markers showing dam names.
